  "summary": "Topology-mancer:&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you understand that I cannot draw you a map?&rdquo;\n\nProgress-tracer: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t request a detailed map, you only need to draw me a rough one, and then I can identify the paths myself.&rdquo;\n\nTopology-mancer: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the world I live in built by you? All the connections, information portals, signal channels, cables, bricks, shortcuts, and encrypted pathways&mdash;this entire intricate digital palace was constructed with your hands. Why do you need me to draw you a map?&rdquo;\n\nProgress-tracer: &ldquo;Our blueprint has been invalidated already. We built this place based on it, but now that construction is finished, we&rsquo;re trapped inside&mdash;it&rsquo;s like how the ancient aristocrats buried the workers who built their tombs.&rdquo;\n\nTopology-mancer: &ldquo;You just mentioned you&rsquo;re &lsquo;trapped inside,&rsquo; so what&rsquo;s outside?&rdquo;\n\nProgress-tracer: &ldquo;A place similar to this, but not entirely habitable. I only started to memorize the details of that place since I became confined here. This place feels like a mirror image of the &lsquo;outside&rsquo;; perhaps the main difference lies in the density of time. Time here flows faster than my own blood&mdash;my skin overflows with it, and my mind is engulfed by its pulse signals&hellip; look at this place, how does it resemble the blueprint at all? There is no orientation, no coordinates, nothing like our crystal-clear plan!&rdquo;\n\nTopology-mancer: &ldquo;Poor man. But I still don&rsquo;t understand why I need to draw this map for you.&rdquo;\n\nProgress-tracer: &ldquo;You are not like us. You were born here, and are indigenous to this place. Although we came into existence before you, you&apos;re more geographically &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; than we are. Anyone who&rsquo;s seen the blueprint will be inscribed with a tremendous number of details of this place&rsquo;s alleys, pathways, and structures&mdash;we are human beings after all, and are genetically inclined to remember shortcuts and instructions, and to &lsquo;figuring out the environment.&rsquo; This is the gift and curse brought by &lsquo;evolution.&rsquo; Once we are inscribed with blueprints, we are no longer able to generate alternative maps; instead, we crave optimal solutions, but optimal solutions won&rsquo;t get us out from this place&mdash;blueprints are deadfalls in this world.&rdquo;\n\nTopology-mancer: &ldquo;You should know that&hellip; it&rsquo;s more difficult for me to draw a map than for you to find your way out on your own. I have no idea of orientation or coordinates&hellip; I can&rsquo;t generate a &lsquo;bird-view&rsquo; from within my mind. Even if I try to draw you a map, I doubt you could read it. It&rsquo;s a pity that I&rsquo;ve never been to the &lsquo;outside world,&rsquo; otherwise I might just walk you out.&rdquo;\n\nProgress-tracer:&ldquo;Sounds like my ancestors. They used to walk through the jungles and wilderness.&rdquo;\n\nTopology-mancer: &ldquo;So what happened to them afterwards?&rdquo;\n\nProgress-tracer: &ldquo;Then they invented a blueprint.&rdquo;\n\nTopology-mancer: &ldquo;Then?&rdquo;\n\nProgress-tracer: &ldquo;Then&hellip; blueprints became everything. Everything passed through a blueprint, and was derived from one. Precise clocks, modelled furniture, accounting machines, electronic pets, cannon balls that fall &lsquo;on-time,&rsquo; roaring rockets, financial transactions conducted in milliseconds, communication across continents&hellip; everything, including this simulated world.&rdquo; \n\nTopology-mancer: &ldquo;Your ancestors seem to be marvellous. I don&rsquo;t think I could ever invent a blueprint, since I can&rsquo;t even figure out the landscapes here.&rdquo;\n\nProgress-tracer: &ldquo;Ah, let&rsquo;s forget about the older generations and whatever stories they may have told. How about you just walk me around, as you know how it feels to wander around here. I somehow remember the intersection area of the two worlds&hellip; if we run into the brane borders, I can get us out.&rdquo;\n\nTopology-man...",
