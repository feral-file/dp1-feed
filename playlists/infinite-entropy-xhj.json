  "summary": "An interview between Feral File and Rafaël Rozendaal ahead of the opening of his solo exhibition Infinite Entropy. \n\n<b>Is the piece “Infinite Entropy,” also the name of the exhibition, something that you created expressly for this show, or how did it come about?</b>\n\nI’d been making websites for 20 years, and I had so many domain names and server issues to manage that it stopped being fun. I liked making them, but I didn’t like publishing them. So I had a whole three years of unpublished works before NFTs came along, and all of a sudden it seemed to fit that very well.\n\nThis work in particular was something that I made for an exhibition called <a href=\"https://www.newrafael.com/permanent-distraction/\">Permanent Distraction</a> at Site Gallery in the UK. When the lockdown started, the exhibition was postponed for two years, and in the meantime we did an online exhibition. This work was published with some other works on the Site Gallery website, but it wasn’t in the final selection for Permanent Distraction. I kept playing with it and it never felt finished, but I think now it has really found its place. \n\n<b>This work has a softer composition than a lot of your other works. Why is that?</b>\n\nThe way I think visually is with lines — it’s very simple, and very quick; it’s similar to drawing diagrams. But for this piece I was drawing circles, and though it’s still the simple instruction of a circle, I also added a level of transparency that I hadn’t used before. The content of the circle becomes transparent over the spreading out, the further you get from the center. As with all of my works, this one was made with a bunch of small steps — the transparency was just one of those small steps, but it creates a very different visual result. \n\nWith this piece I also wanted to play with the idea of emptiness and things being filled up and busy. There’s constantly a tension between where you feel like there’s some space and where it feels very crowded. The script is simple: it’s just these circles moving from the center outward, getting bigger. They’re not moving towards you, but there is a false sense of depth, like moving through clouds. I’ve always liked the kinds of paintings where you're suggesting depth, but it’s barely there. \n\n<b>Do you place work like this in the tradition of Op Art? Or are there other foundations for this work?</b>\n\nIt’s strange because my work started as more figurative and slowly became abstract. I appreciate Op Art now more than before, but it was never a big thing on my radar. I was thinking more about Pre War Abstraction. In a Bridget Riley painting, for example, that sort of hard edge painting is quite difficult, but in code it’s the simplest thing you can do. It might look the same, but in terms of working method, there are way more advanced media artists that can create really complex, rich, and much more dense work than I do. My aesthetic comes from more of a punk mindset: it’s usually a very straightforward, direct idea — like, power cord, right there, boom. So to me, my work is closer to the Ramones than to Bridget Riley.\n\n<b>I see a lot of historical references in your work. Do you feel that you’ve been more influenced by the history of experimental animation, or music, or that of Pre War Abstraction? Or all of them?</b>\n\nMy dad is an abstract geometric painter, so it would be me with the TV on in the living room and him in his studio making abstract paintings. I see my work as somewhere between Looney Tunes/Mickey Mouse and Malevich/Mondrian. \n\nGrowing up in the Netherlands, the museum collections there go back very far and they haven’t collected as much American abstraction. In Europe, it was like Malevich and Mondrian did everything. It’s almost unthinkable to do anything in abstraction because it just looks like Mondrian. He is such a hero there. After coming to the U.S., it was quite liberating to find out that abstraction doesn’t end with the black square — that was the beginning. I didn’t know Ad Reinhardt, or Agnes Martin, or even Bridget Riley, at least in depth.\n\nBeing in New Yor...",
